                    The Visible Speech (VISP) infrastructure provides access to a centralized environment for spoken language research that strives to meet both researchers' need for efficient workflows and the legislator's requirement of secured data management.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The infrastructure offers the research community a unified environment for conducting reproducible speech signal processing in an environment that supports national and international collaborations.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Digital archiving of hosted projects is also made easier by a uniform, documented, and transparent directory structure for all projects in VISP, which also reduces barriers to making data available in accordance with the FAIR principles.

                    Due to the high security nature of the VISP system, it is only available to a selection people and projects.
                    But please don't hesitate to get in touch with one of the principal project members if you think the VISP system might be useful to you.
