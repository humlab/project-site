                The Visible Speech (VISP) infrastructure provides access to a centralized environment for spoken language research that strives to meet both researchers' need for efficient workflows and the legislator's requirement of secured data management.
            <br/><br/>
                The infrastructure offers the research community a unified environment for conducting reproducible speech signal processing in an environment that supports national and international collaborations.
            <br/><br/>
                Digital archiving of hosted projects is also made easier by a uniform, documented, and transparent directory structure for all projects in VISP, which also reduces barriers to making data available in accordance with the FAIR principles.
